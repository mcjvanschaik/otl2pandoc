otl2pandoc
	: Otl2pandoc is a simple script that enables you to make a quick outline
	: using the Vim Outliner or votl plugins. 
	Workflow
		: When writing in otl you can easily fold the text. The plugins show the
		: type of node when you have started using a prefix. To publish to a PDF you
		: can convert the document via otl2pandoc to pandoc and use this to create
		: the new file.
	Metadata
		: Pandoc supports a simple header using % signs. These are supported in
		: otl2pandoc.
	Verbatim text or code
		: It is possible to use a > or < to write text that will be marked to be
		: show verbatim. In order for the text to be processed properly an empty
		: line should precede the table. In the otl-file this should be forced
		: with a line stat starts with : or ;.

	Tables
		: reStructuredText tables can be used in pandoc and will be passed to the
		: markdown file. In order for the table to be processed properly an empty
		: line should precede the table. In the otl-file this should be forced
		: with a line stat starts with : or ;.
		:
		: If a line starts with a special character as used in the otl-fileformat,
		: it will be interpreted as indicated in the table below.
